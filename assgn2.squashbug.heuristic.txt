The heuristic that I have used for finding the prospective root malware is that I having finding all the parents,grandparents and so on. Then I am finding percentage of CPU usage for all the list of parents. The percentage of CPU usage is the ratio of total time spent by that process in user or kernel mode to the time elapsed since the start of the process multiplied by 100. Among all the list of parents the process which has less than 0.001 percent of CPU usage is my suggested root of all malwares.
